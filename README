Synctl version 1.0.0
====================

Backup and restore your files locally or through ssh with the perl Synctl
module and the front-end synctl program. The backups are made incrementally
with internal file deduplication and checksum verification.

While this tool was initially based on rsync, it now uses its own protocol
which allows several interesting features :

  * Path-agnostic deduplication : while incremental backups can be performed
    with rsync, the action of renaming or moving a file prevent rsync to
    perform deduplication. Synctl stores the content of the files independently
    of their path, which allows to optimize disk space more aggressively.

  * Pre-computed checksums : to safely compare client and server files, rsync
    compute the checksums of the files in both sides, stressing the I/O system
    of the server. Synctl computes the checksum of each file when they are
    received the first time and reuse these same checksums the next time.

  * Reduced FS requirements : acting as root or connecting as root through ssh
    is security issue, so rsync allows to make backups as a fake super user by
    storing files mode and ownership as xattrs, which is not supported by all
    filesystems. Synctl only require to create, modify and delete files and
    directories.
